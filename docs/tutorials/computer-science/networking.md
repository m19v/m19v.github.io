## Intro

Networking Fundamentals to prepare for Cisco Certified Network Associate (CCNA).

## Tools

[Cisco Packet Tracer](https://skillsforall.com/course/getting-started-cisco-packet-tracer), an innovative network configuration simulation tool.

## Basic networking terms

### Computer network

A **computer network** is a group of two or more computers that are linked together used to share resources, to exchange files, or to communicate with others.

### MAC address

A **MAC address** (short for medium access control address) is a unique identifier assigned to a network interface controller (NIC) for use as a network address in communications within a network segment.  
**MAC address formats**: XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX, XX-XX-XX-XX-XX-XX or XXXXXXXXXXXX - 6 groups of 2 hexadecimal digits (12-digit: 6 bytes or 48 bits).

### DHCP

The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (**DHCP**) is a network management protocol used on Internet Protocol (**IP**) networks for automatically assigning IP addresses and other communication parameters to devices connected to the network using a clientâ€“server architecture

## Network devices

### Repeater

A **Repeater** is an electronic device that receives a signal and retransmits it. Repeaters are used to extend transmissions so that the signal can cover longer distances or be received on the other side of an obstruction.  
Some types of repeaters broadcast an identical signal, but alter its method of transmission, for example, on another frequency or baud rate (speed of communication).

### Network switch

A **network switch** (also called **switching hub**, **bridging hub**, and, by the IEEE, **MAC bridge**) is networking hardware that connects devices on a computer network by using packet switching to receive and forward data to the destination device.  
A network switch is a multiport network bridge that uses MAC addresses to forward data at the _data link layer_ (layer 2) of the _OSI model_. Some switches can also forward data at the _network layer_ (layer 3) by additionally incorporating routing functionality. Such switches are commonly known as _layer-3 switches_ or _multilayer switches_.
