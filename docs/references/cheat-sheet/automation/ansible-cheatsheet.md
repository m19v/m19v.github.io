## Ansible

- Ansible is an open source engine that automates application deployment, orchestration, cloud provisioning etc. 
- It uses human readable YAML syntax for Ansible Playbooks to describe automation jobs. 
- Ansible is agent-less and designed for multi-tier deployment. Connects nodes via ssh by pushing "Ansible modules" which is removed after its execution.

## Environment Setup

### Types of machines:

- Control machine − a system on which Ansible is installed which manages other machines by executing playbook.
- Remote machine − a remote system managed by control machine.

### Control Machine Requirement

- Python 3 or higher

### Installation

**Option 1.** Configure PPA on control machine and install Ansible as follows:

```shell
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install software-properties-common 
sudo apt-add-repository ppa:ansible/ansible $ sudo apt-get update 
sudo apt-get install ansible
```
**Option 2.** Install Ansible using ```python pip```

```shell
python3 -m pip install --user ansible
```
